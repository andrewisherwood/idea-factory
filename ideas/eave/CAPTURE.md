## Raw Capture

Eave is a personal operations layer. It starts with email and grows into a life-management agent that can read, think, and act on your behalf. The core promise: you never open an email again. Over time, you never manage a password, chase a subscription, or fight a clunky website again either.

Built for neurodivergent brains first — people drowning in admin not because they're incapable, but because the friction of mundane digital tasks overwhelms executive function. Part of the S.A.F.E. suite (Suppertime, Adaptive Coach, Eave). Domain: eave.is.

## Initial Gut Check

- **Problem it solves:** Email overload and life admin paralysis, especially for neurodivergent brains. Six email accounts, drowning in admin.
- **Who has this problem:** Andy daily, and anyone whose executive function is overwhelmed by mundane digital tasks.
- **Why me / why now:** Blocked until Suppertime ships and proves the monetise loop. But this is the flagship — a painkiller, not a vitamin. V1 email triage is a tight 2-week build once the path is clear.
