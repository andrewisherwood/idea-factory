## Problem Statement

[What specific problem does this solve? Who experiences it? How painful is it?]

## Proposed Solution

[High-level description. What does v1 look like?]

## Target Platform

[iOS / PWA / Web / CLI / API — be specific]

## Evaluation Criteria

### Personal Dog-fooding
- [ ] Does Andy personally have this problem?
- [ ] Would Andy use this daily/weekly?

### Build Feasibility
- [ ] Can v1 ship in under 2 weeks of solo dev time?
- [ ] Does it fit within the ~15hr/week constraint?
- [ ] Are there hard technical unknowns?

### Portfolio Fit
- [ ] Does this fit under the Dopamine Labs umbrella?
- [ ] Does it overlap with or cannibalise an existing product?
- [ ] Does it strengthen the portfolio narrative?

### Market & Monetisation
- [ ] Is there a clear monetisation path?
- [ ] What's the competitive landscape?
- [ ] Is this a vitamin or a painkiller?

### Neurodivergent Design
- [ ] Does it reduce executive function load (not add to it)?
- [ ] Is the core interaction low-friction?
- [ ] Does it work with how Andy's brain works, not against it?

## Technical Considerations

## Open Questions

[What needs answering before a decision can be made?]
