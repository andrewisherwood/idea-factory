## Positioning

### One-liner

[Complete this sentence: "[Product] helps [audience] [do what] by [how]."]

### What it is (and isn't)

[Two or three sentences. Be specific about scope. Explicitly call out what it doesn't do if there's a common misconception.]

### Key differentiator

[One thing that makes this different from alternatives. Not "better" — different.]

## Target Audience

### Primary

[Be specific. Not "developers" — "solo indie devs shipping side projects after work hours." Not "families" — "parents who meal plan on Sunday for the week ahead."]

### Secondary

[Who else benefits? This is a stretch audience, not the core.]

### Anti-audience

[Who is this NOT for? Defining this sharpens everything else.]

## Channels

[Where does the target audience already hang out? Only list channels you'll actually use. Two good channels beat six neglected ones.]

| Channel | Why | Effort |
|---------|-----|--------|
| | | Low / Medium / High |

## Launch Sequence

### Pre-launch

- [ ] [What happens before launch day? Landing page, waitlist, teaser content, beta invites?]

### Launch

- [ ] [The launch day itself. Where do you post? What's the hook?]

### Post-launch

- [ ] [First week after launch. Follow-up content, responding to feedback, iteration signals.]

## Content Plan

[What content supports this product? Blog posts, social threads, demo videos, case studies? List only what you'll realistically create given the 15hr/week constraint.]

| Content | Format | When | Purpose |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| | | | |
