# Tri-Model Adversarial Review — [Idea Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scoping Doc Version Reviewed:** [link or commit hash]
**Models Used:** Claude (Opus 4.6) · GPT-4o · Gemini 2.5 Pro

---

## Review Brief

The following SCOPING.md was provided to each model with identical instructions:

> Review this product scoping document. Your job is adversarial — find what's wrong, what's missing, and what will fail. Specifically:
>
> 1. **Blind spots** — What hasn't been considered? What assumptions are unstated?
> 2. **Roadblocks** — What technical, market, or practical obstacles could kill this?
> 3. **Weaknesses in the evaluation** — Where is the scoping document being generous to itself?
> 4. **Competitive threats** — What existing products or approaches make this redundant?
> 5. **The kill case** — Make the strongest possible argument for why this idea should NOT be built.
> 6. **The save** — If you had to rescue one thing from this idea, what's the core insight worth preserving even if the product as scoped is wrong?
>
> Be direct. Do not glaze. The builder has limited time and needs honest assessment, not encouragement.

## Synthesis

### Points of Agreement (all three flagged)

These carry the most weight — three different models with different training data identified the same issue.

| Issue | Claude | GPT | Gemini | Severity |
|-------|--------|-----|--------|----------|
| | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | High/Med/Low |

### Points of Disagreement

Where models diverged is where the most interesting thinking happens. Examine the reasoning, not just the conclusion.

| Issue | Claude Says | GPT Says | Gemini Says | Andy's Call |
|-------|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| | | | | |

### Glaze Check

Did any model fail to engage critically? Note it here. A model that only praises is providing zero signal.

| Model | Adversarial Quality | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Claude | Strong / Adequate / Weak | |
| GPT | Strong / Adequate / Weak | |
| Gemini | Strong / Adequate / Weak | |
