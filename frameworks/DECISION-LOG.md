# Decision Log

A chronological record of all idea decisions. Preserved for pattern recognition and accountability.

| Date | Idea | Decision | Score | Key Rationale | Revisit? |
|------|------|----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| 2026-02-14 | Marketing Factory | Absorbed | N/A | Not a separate product — the problem is solved by adding a `MARKETING-BRIEF.md` template as a required gate in the Idea Factory promotion step. | No |
| 2026-02-14 | Marketing Agent | Parked | N/A | Eave fork for executing marketing briefs. Hard dependency on Eave having agent-action capabilities (auth, API integrations, acting on behalf of user). Can't score until foundation exists. | Yes — when Eave ships agent actions |
