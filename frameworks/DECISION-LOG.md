# Decision Log

A chronological record of all idea decisions. Preserved for pattern recognition and accountability.

| Date | Idea | Decision | Score | Key Rationale | Revisit? |
|------|------|----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| 2026-02-14 | Marketing Factory | Absorbed | N/A | Not a separate product — the problem is solved by adding a `MARKETING-BRIEF.md` template as a required gate in the Idea Factory promotion step. | No |
| 2026-02-14 | Marketing Agent | Parked | N/A | Eave fork for executing marketing briefs. Hard dependency on Eave having agent-action capabilities (auth, API integrations, acting on behalf of user). Can't score until foundation exists. | Yes — when Eave ships agent actions |
| 2026-02-14 | Blur | Parked | N/A | Brutally minimal RSVP speed reader (PWA). Scoped externally. Personal itch but vitamin not painkiller, niche market. Small build when there's bandwidth. | Yes — periodic review |
| 2026-02-14 | Eave | Pending | 25 (Track A) | Personal ops layer. V0 reframed as household management app ingest layer. Email triage reframed as CC workflow. Scoped, tri-model reviewed, reframed. Blocked on household management app scoping. | Yes — when household app is scoped |
| 2026-02-14 | Eave Capture | Absorbed | N/A | Universal capture/routing layer folded into Eave as V0. Not a standalone product — becomes Eave's permanent input layer. Ships before email triage to validate core UX. | No |
| 2026-02-16 | Idea Factory Mobile | Killed | N/A | Siri Shortcut built on 2026-02-14 solves 80%+ of the capture problem. Voice to repo in ~10 seconds. Remaining gap doesn't justify a build. | No |
| 2026-02-16 | Idea Factory as Product | Parked | N/A | The factory itself as a regulation tool for AuDHD polymaths. Genuine insight but the factory correctly caught itself trying to become the next shiny thing. | Yes — periodic review |
| 2026-02-16 | Dopamine Labs Website | Reclassified | N/A | Not an idea — a task. Siri capture "Create a website for dopaminelaboratory.com." Removed from pipeline. | No |
| 2026-02-16 | Agency Folk Marketing | Reclassified | N/A | Not an idea — a task. Siri capture about using a gathering to market products. Removed from pipeline. | No |
| 2026-02-16 | BirthBuild | Scoping | N/A | AI-powered website builder for birth workers. Real first customer with student cohort. Promoted to `ideas/birthbuild/` for Track B evaluation. | Yes — pending evaluation |
| 2026-02-18 | VerticalBuild Strategy | Shelved | N/A | Platform strategy for horizontal scaling of BirthBuild to 50+ profession verticals. Well-constructed strategic thinking but premature — builds a cathedral on unvalidated foundations. BirthBuild itself is 45/70 (viable but risky), hasn't shipped, and has no usage data. Moved to `ideas/birthbuild/STRATEGY-VERTICALBUILD.md` as long-term vision document. Not an idea to scope independently — it's a future phase contingent on BirthBuild V1 proving the core thesis. | Yes — when BirthBuild V1 has real usage data |
