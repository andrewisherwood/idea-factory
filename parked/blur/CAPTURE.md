## Raw Capture

Existing RSVP speed reading apps are either buried in features, broken, or have friction that gets in the way of just reading fast. Andy wants to upload an epub of a Ray Dalio book and read it in several hours at 600-1000+ WPM. Every app he tested (speed-reader.com, Reedy, others) fails on UX — clunky interfaces, no library, poor controls, bad chunking.

Proposed solution: a brutally minimal RSVP speed reader. No accounts, no social features, no gamification. Just a personal library and a clean reading interface that gets out of the way. PWA, dark UI, ORP highlighting.

## Initial Gut Check

- **Problem it solves:** No good, minimal RSVP speed reader exists. Everything is overbuilt or broken.
- **Who has this problem:** Readers who want to consume books/articles faster without friction.
- **Why me / why now:** Personal itch. Small build. But it's a vitamin, not a painkiller — and the market is niche.
