## Raw Capture

Marketing Agent — Eave fork that executes the marketing factory's output. Account creation, content posting, scheduling, analytics. Depends on Eave's capabilities existing first.

## Initial Gut Check

- **Problem it solves:** The marketing brief exists but nobody executes it. Andy doesn't have the hours or the executive function bandwidth to manually post across channels, schedule content, track analytics, and maintain marketing momentum alongside building product.
- **Who has this problem:** Andy, and any solo dev who ships but can't sustain marketing effort.
- **Why me / why now:** Not now — this depends on Eave's agent capabilities being built first. But it should be captured because the pipeline design (Idea Factory → Marketing Brief → ???) has a clear execution gap. When Eave can act on behalf of a user, this becomes a fork of that capability pointed at marketing tasks.
