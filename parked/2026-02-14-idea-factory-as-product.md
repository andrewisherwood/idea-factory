# Idea Factory as a Product

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Source:** Reflection at the end of a full-day ideation session. The factory processed Eave from a six-version SaaS fantasy down to a focused personal tool in one afternoon. Realised the factory itself is the product.

## Raw Capture

The idea factory isn't a dev tool. It's a regulation tool for brains that generate ideas faster than they can execute them.

The capture, lifecycle, evaluation framework, tri-model adversarial review, dual-track system, kill gates — that's externalised executive function. It doesn't just organise ideas. It protects you from your own enthusiasm. Without it, Eave would be three weekends into a password manager build right now.

The market is AuDHD founders, polymaths, creatives — anyone with 40 ideas in their Notes app, 12 half-started projects, and a gnawing sense they're spreading too thin but can't stop starting. They need structure that doesn't feel like structure. A system that catches ideas without friction, develops them honestly, and kills the bad ones before they waste build time.

Today's session is the proof of concept. One idea in, processed through capture → scoping → tri-model review → reframing → re-evaluation. What came out was radically simpler and better than what went in.

The irony: this idea is itself the factory trying to become the next shiny thing. Which is exactly the pattern it's designed to catch. Park it. Scope later.

## Initial Gut Check

- **Problem it solves:** Idea overwhelm and project sprawl for neurodivergent builders
- **Who has this problem:** AuDHD founders, polymaths, creatives, anyone who starts more than they finish
- **Why me / why now:** Just built it, just lived it, just proved it works in one session
