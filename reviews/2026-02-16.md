# Weekly Idea Review — 2026-02-16

## Inbox Triage

| Idea | Action | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **BirthBuild** (new) | Scope | Real customer, real distribution, known stack. But needs proper Track evaluation and honest capacity check before committing. See detailed notes below. |
| Marketing Factory | Clean from inbox | Already absorbed into pipeline on 2026-02-14 — the MARKETING-BRIEF.md template is the solution. Decision log recorded. Remove from inbox. |
| Idea Factory Mobile | Kill | The Siri Shortcut built on 2026-02-14 solves 80%+ of the capture problem. Voice to repo in ~10 seconds. The remaining gap (text/visual capture away from Siri) doesn't justify a build. If the Shortcut proves insufficient, the failure mode will reveal what's actually needed. |
| Household Management App | Scope (but not yet) | Strategically the most important idea in the inbox — the potential Dopamine Labs flagship. But scoping this properly is a big piece of work, and building it is bigger. Queue behind Suppertime and the BirthBuild decision. |
| Idea Factory as Product | Move to parked/ | Session summary already marked this parked. The capture itself notes the irony — the factory catching its own idea trying to become a shiny thing. Correctly parked. Move the file. |
| "Create a website for dopaminelaboratory.com" | Reclassify as task | This isn't an idea — it's a TODO. Dopamine Labs needs a website, but this belongs on a task list, not in the ideation pipeline. |
| "Use the agency folk gathering to market my products and skills" | Reclassify as task | Marketing/networking opportunity. Not an idea to scope — it's an action item with a time window. |

### BirthBuild — Detailed Notes

This arrived hot. Domain registered, repo exists, Supabase project provisioned, first customer identified with a cohort of students. The momentum is real. But the factory needs to do its job.

**What's right:**
- Real first customer with built-in distribution (instructor's students)
- Low financial risk (instructor pays API costs, Andy retains IP)
- Known stack — React, Supabase, MAI. No new technology risk.
- V1 scope is genuinely tight — chat-to-site builder, not a platform
- The horizontal play (profession-agnostic architecture) is a legitimate structural advantage

**What the factory needs to catch:**

1. **The self-scoring doesn't use this factory's framework.** It scored 35/40 on 8 custom criteria. But the idea factory has Track A (6 criteria, max 30) and Track B (14 criteria, max 70). BirthBuild needs to be evaluated against the actual framework.

2. **This skips Track A entirely.** BirthBuild isn't a personal tool — it's a product for someone else from day one. The dual-track system assumes personal tools first, products later. This is a different category: a client project with productisation potential. The framework doesn't have a clean path for this.

3. **No tri-model review.** Recommended before committing build time.

4. **Defensibility is weak.** Scored 3/5 in the self-assessment, and that's generous. The moat is "execution speed + MAI pipeline," which is a head start, not a moat. Every AI website builder (Framer AI, Durable, 10Web, Hostinger AI, Mixo) is converging on this exact interaction model. The birth-worker vertical positioning is the real differentiator, not the technology.

5. **"Every solo practitioner in every profession" is scope gravity.** The horizontal scale play is the textbook seductive vision that the factory is designed to catch. V1 is birth workers. V1 should stay birth workers. The horizontal play goes in the "future vision" section, not the decision criteria.

6. **Revenue model is V2.** V1 is free — instructor pays API costs only. That's fine as a portfolio piece and customer relationship, but the "monetisation path: 5/5" score is aspirational, not validated.

7. **15 hours/week.** This is the hard constraint. BirthBuild competes directly with Suppertime (App Store submission), Adaptive Coach (active development), and existing maintenance. Adding another active build is the exact pattern that produces half-finished projects.

**Recommendation:** Scope it properly using the factory's framework. Because it's not a personal tool, evaluate directly on Track B criteria. Run a tri-model review focused on competitive landscape (AI website builders are a crowded space) and the instructor partnership model. Then make the build/park/kill decision with honest data.

**The real question:** Is BirthBuild the right thing to build *right now*, or is it the right thing to build *after Suppertime ships*?

## Parked Ideas Reassessment

| Idea | Status Change? | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Marketing Agent | No change | Still depends on Eave agent capabilities that don't exist yet. Correctly parked. |
| Blur | No change | Still a vitamin with niche market. No bandwidth has freed up. Good weekend project when there's genuine slack, which there currently isn't. |

## Active Scoping Updates

| Idea | Progress | Blockers | Next Step |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Eave | Scoped, reviewed, reframed | Blocked on household management app scoping — V0 is the ingest layer for that app | Household management app needs to be scoped before Eave V0 can proceed. Email triage validated as CC workflow (independent of the app). |

**Note on Eave:** The decision log still says "Revisit when Suppertime ships" but the session summary explicitly removed Suppertime as a blocker. The decision log entry should be updated to reflect the current state: Eave is blocked on the household management app scoping, not on Suppertime.

## Portfolio Health Check

- **Current active builds:** Suppertime (App Store prep), Adaptive Coach (active dev), MAI V3 (infrastructure)
- **Estimated weekly hours committed:** Likely 12-15 hrs across the three active projects
- **Capacity for new work:** No. Not until Suppertime ships or Adaptive Coach reaches a stable milestone.
- **Spreading thin?** Not yet — but BirthBuild threatens to tip the balance. Four active builds at 15 hrs/week is how projects die.

## Pipeline Hygiene

Items that need cleaning (no decisions required, just housekeeping):

1. Move `inbox/2026-02-14-marketing-factory.md` to killed/ or delete — it's been absorbed
2. Move `inbox/2026-02-14-idea-factory-as-product.md` to `parked/`
3. Delete or archive `inbox/2026-02-14-230827.md` and `inbox/2026-02-14-231212.md` — these are tasks, not ideas
4. Update the Eave decision log entry to remove "Revisit when Suppertime ships" — replaced by "Blocked on household app scoping"

## Recommendations

1. **Ship Suppertime.** This is the #1 priority and the thing closest to revenue. App Store submission should not be delayed by new ideas.

2. **Scope BirthBuild properly before committing.** The momentum is real and the opportunity is time-sensitive (instructor has a cohort now). But run it through the factory: Track B evaluation, tri-model review (focused on AI website builder competitive landscape), and an honest capacity assessment. If it passes, it may warrant pausing Adaptive Coach temporarily — but that's a conscious portfolio decision, not a default.

3. **Don't scope the household management app yet.** It's the most strategically important idea in the pipeline, but it's also the biggest. Scoping it properly will take significant thought, and the temptation to start building immediately will be strong. Queue it for after Suppertime ships.

4. **Clean the inbox.** Seven items, three of which aren't ideas. Get it down to the two that matter: BirthBuild and Household Management App.

5. **The pattern to watch:** Two sessions in, the factory has already caught the right things — Eave's premature productisation, the password manager kill, the factory-as-product irony. The risk now is that BirthBuild's external validation (real customer, real students) bypasses the factory's quality gates. A real customer doesn't make a bad idea good — it makes a bad idea harder to kill. Run BirthBuild through the full process.
