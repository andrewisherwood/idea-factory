## Raw Capture

Marketing Factory — the strategy gate between promoted ideas and MAI. Defines positioning, target audience, channels, launch sequence, content plan. Every promoted idea must have a marketing brief before it gets built.

## Initial Gut Check

- **Problem it solves:** No structured marketing thinking happens before build. Ideas get promoted and go straight to code. Positioning, audience, and go-to-market are afterthoughts — or never happen at all.
- **Who has this problem:** Andy, specifically. Solo devs who ship but don't market.
- **Why me / why now:** The pipeline has a gap. Idea Factory evaluates whether to build. MAI builds it. Nothing in between forces you to think about who it's for and how they'll find it.
